      <h3> What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h3>
      <p>Answer: DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document.
        We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.
        The DOM views an HTML document as a tree of nodes. A node represents an HTML element.</p>

       <h3> How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h3>
       <p>
            There are a few different methods for selecting an element in the HTML document.
            I will focus on three of those methods:
            1.getElementById()
            In HTML, ids are used as unique identifiers for the HTML elements. This means you cannot have the same id name for two different elements.
            2.querySelector()
            we can use this method to find elements with one or more CSS selectors.
            3.querySelectorAll()  
            This method finds all of the elements that match the CSS selector and returns a list of all of those nodes.
