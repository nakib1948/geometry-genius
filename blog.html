        <!-- Question-1 -->
      <h3> What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h3>
      <p> <b>Answer:</b>  DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document.
        We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.
        The DOM views an HTML document as a tree of nodes. A node represents an HTML element.</p>
       <br>
       
       <!-- Question-2 -->
       <h3> How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h3>
       <p>
            <b>Answer:</b>
            There are a few different methods for selecting an element in the HTML document.
            I will focus on three of those methods:
            1.getElementById()
            In HTML, ids are used as unique identifiers for the HTML elements. This means you cannot have the same id name for two different elements.
            2.querySelector()
            we can use this method to find elements with one or more CSS selectors.
            3.querySelectorAll()  
            This method finds all of the elements that match the CSS selector and returns a list of all of those nodes.
       </p>

       <!-- question-3 -->
       <h3>What is event bubble?</h3>
       <p>Event bubbling is ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM API, when an event occurs in an     element inside another element,
         and both elements have registered a handle for that event.With bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements.We can use the addEventListener(type, listener, useCapture) to register event handlers for in either bubbling</p>


         <!-- Question-4 -->
         <h3>What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h3>
         <p>A callback function is a function which can be sent to another fuction as an argument.
            then from that function we can call it.When I want one function to execute only after another function has completed its execution then I can use callback function.
